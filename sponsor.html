            <p>When you sponsor a child, you care for and encourage them through prayer, letter writing and
                financial support. That support empowers a local church to individually and holistically
                meet their needs in a loving, safe community where they can learn, grow, play and dream.
                When you become a sponsor, you are personallly connected with a child who will know your name
                and treasure the thought that you care about them.
                Your support gives a child life-changing opportunity to develop spiritually, emotionally,
                physically and economically. It's a relationship more powerful than poverty -- changing
                their life and yours!
