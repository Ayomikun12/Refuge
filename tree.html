                            <h2>This Ministry</h2>
                        <p class="ministry">
                           In 2015 to meet our personal Soul-Winning duties as Christians. Pastor Justin
                            was recovering from his accident, resulting in loss of his left leg and Missionary Patricia,
                            because of her age and recovering from knee surgery was no longer able to walk the streets
                            sharing the Gospel.
                            Since that time we see the Lord working all across Nigeria. We have ministered in Makurdi,
                            Vandeikyia, Ugba, Ogoja, IDP camps and others places in Benue State; Jos, Zarazon, Shendam,
                            Panchine and Langtang in Plateau State; Minna in Niger State; Calabar in Rivers State;
                            Ogbomoso, and Ibadan in Oyo State ; and to Port Harcourt; and to Osun State; Churches in
                            Kaduna and in Katsina, churches in Port Harcourt and Uyo in Akwa Ibom; Fulani village in
                            Keana LGA in Nasarawa State and soon in Kwara State. So many places that I have lost track
                            of them all. We have taught and preached to small groups and to groups of thousands. We have
                            taught and preached in the daytime and in the nighttime using torchlight.
                            And God has moved in mighty ways every time!!
                            We bring the Gospel to schools, villages, even roadside areas where people are gathered.
                            We encourage other independent Baptist churches doing revival meetings, ladies conferences,
                            & marriage seminars for couples. 
                            Wherever God has led us, we have gone. 
                            As a team we travel with a driver and an interpreter as needed. Occasionally, a Seminary
                            student will travel with us to learn about the different field opportunities.
                            The ministry started out at our local level and soon requests for meetings came to us from
                            across Nigeria. People are hungry for the Gospel. The Gospel still works, and God is still
                            saving souls.!!!! We average about 8 meetings a year
                            We have seen miracles upon miracles as we travel. Our village visits are especially rewarding
                            as we listen to testimonies over the years of how God has changed lives and restored marriages.
                            We travel by faith and go to some of the most dangerous places in the world. God always takes
                            care of us and protects us.
                            We have seen people who were sick and received Christ only to learn that shortly after they
                            passed onto eternity. We've been to villages where they beg us to stay and start churches
                            because they want their children to grow up in the truth. The fields are truly white unto
                            harvest, but the laborers are few. We've seen marriages restored and lives turned around.
                            So many testimonies of God's grace and goodness.
                            We often show Christian films in the villages and see great responses in Fulani and Muslim
                            villages. Even in the rain, hundreds turn out for these shows and receive Christ. There is
                            still much work to be done. There is a cost, and many sacrifices to be made. But God is
                            glorified, and we will see the rewards in Heaven one day. A great multitude of souls saved.
                            Please pray for Missionary Patricia and Pastor Justin for good health, continued wisdom and
                            strength, as we continue in this great ministry.
