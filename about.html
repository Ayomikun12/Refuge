                        <p>At city of Refuge we provide a safe haven for displaced and persecuted Fulani Christians.
                             We seek to educate them in the Bible and encourage them to be self-reliant. We encourage
                             them to understand that Jesus and Salvation is the key to happiness and holiness in their
                             daily life. A property was purchased in a wide-open area(a safe haven). We built one unit
                             of eight double rooms and a passage that will provide housing for families. Another unit
                             of single rooms was built for those who are single. Access to a two-toilet water system
                             is also available for a clean water supply. We provide temporary housing, clothing,
                             and feeding for them. They are able to worship without fear, learn skills to rebuild
                             their lives and provide for themselves, educate their children and become independent
                             ultimately, they will be empowered to evangelize their own public ethnic groups with
                             the Gospel.

                    <p>There are no easy answers to what to do when persecution come, especially those from Islam
                        background. Many Fulani men who repented had their wives,children,cattles farm land taken
                        away, women who repent before their husbands may be driving away, divorced and threatened
                        to be killed. As we disciple the new believers, we need to show them that persecution is
                        part of the Christian life and we are willing to help by any means. Persecution most
                        likely will be part the life of any Christian especially who is coming from Muslim
                        background. You will find out that many new Fulani believers are unable to stand
                        firm in the face of pain and suffering.
