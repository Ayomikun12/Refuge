                        The foundation was incorporated by the Corporate Affairs Commission in Abuja in 2018.
                        We are a faith-based mission organized to provide a safe haven for persecuted and displaced
                        Fulani/Hausa Christians with the goal pf salvation as key to happiness and holiness in daily
                        life. Our aims are to bring them out from danger zones to our camp, to train and empower them
                        with the World og God (Bible), to teach them morals as a value to society, and enable them to
                        go back and witness to their own ethnic groups.

                <p class="fulani">Fulani are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, and Africa as a whole. They are a
                    relatively unchanged and unreached group and one of the first ethnic groups to embrace
                    Islam and help spread Islam across Africa. Because of their adherence to Islam, it is a
                    risk for anyone to share the Gospel of Christ with them. It is very dangerous for any
                    Fulani who openly declares his Christian faith. Doing so, would potentially cause the
                    Fulani to flee from his home/town rugga in fear of persecution (even unto death).

                <p class="illit">Illiteracy and distrust of outsiders are other challenges present that make it difficult
                    to reach the Fulani. As faith-based Christian preachers founded the African City of Refuge
                    and Empowerment Foundation, persecuted and displaced Fulani Christians families were enabled
                    to transit out of dangerous places. We offer both life-saving resources and life-rebuilding
                    tools to families and individuals in Nigeria and across the African continent.
