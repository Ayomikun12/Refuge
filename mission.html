                                to flee persecution by their own family member
                                because they refused to renounce Christianity.
                                Their lives were at risk of death and they become
                                wanderers, no home, no cows, no relatives, and their
                                livelihood were lost. They were squatting at a vacant
                                chicken farm and under the mango trees, living on
                                whatever they were able to grow or get.
                                They reached out to us through Rev. Timothy Gideon,
                                (Pastor of Salvation Baptist Church, Abuja) for help
                                and assistance. We realized that God was giving us
                                a great opportunity to reach more Fulani through these
                                Fulani Christians and to prepare them to have a way to
                                support themselves and their family. We were ready to
                                empower them to start a new life in Christ.
