                    <p>At city of Refuge we provide a safe haven for displaced and persecuted Fulani Christians.
                         We seek to educate them in the Bible and encourage them to be self-reliant. We encourage
                         them to understand that Jesus and Salvation is the key to happiness and holiness in their
                         daily life. A property was purchased in a wide-open area(a safe haven). We built one unit
                         of eight double rooms and a passage that will provide housing for families. Another unit
                         of single rooms was built for those who are single. Access to a two-toilet water system
                         is also available for a clean water supply. We provide temporary housing, clothing,
                         and feeding for them. They are able to worship without fear, learn skills to rebuild
                         their lives and provide for themselves, educate their children and become independent
                         ultimately, they will be empowered to evangelize their own public ethnic groups with
                         the Gospel.

            <section class="donate">
                <p>There are no easy answers to what to do when persecution come, especially those from Islam
                    background. Many Fulani men who repented had their wives,children,cattles farm land taken
                    away, women who repent before their husbands may be driving away, divorced and threatened
                    to be killed. As we disciple the new believers, we need to show them that persecution is
                    part of the Christian life and we are willing to help by any means. Persecution most
                    likely will be part the life of any Christian especially who is coming from Muslim
                    background. You will find out that many new Fulani believers are unable to stand
                    firm in the face of pain and suffering.
